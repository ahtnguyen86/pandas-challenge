Pandas Challenge

The analysis summarizes data from 15 schools from district or charter types. It shows data from Total Students, Total Budget, Average Math, and Reading Scores and Passing %.
The analysis also breaks down the budget spent per student at each school and shows the percentage of passing per budget.
We have also summarized the top 5 performing schools as well as the bottom 5. There are also average scores of math and reading broken down by grades. 

Based on the analysis it does show that Charter schools outperform District schools in overall passing percentage. 
The data also shows that a higher budget spent per student does not equate to a higher overall percentage of passing students.
